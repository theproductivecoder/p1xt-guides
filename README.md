# The Productive Coder - Computer Science and Programming

This is a slimmed down verison of the guide from P1xt seen [here](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides/). I've tried to make this as easy to follow as possible, to stop myself from feeling overwhelmed.

Please read the [FAQ](./faq.md) and note that there are  to help you select projects.

## The Productive Coder - List of courses and things to do, in order!

Work through the math section in conjunction with the computer science section. Aim for two hours per day of math, and the rest of my time completing programming/computer science activities.

## Specializations

Each tier has a 'specialization' based capstone which involves further study and extensive practice in an area of your choosing. [Web Development - Fullstack Bootcamp - App Academy Open](./specializations/app_academy_open.md) is highly recommended (but not required) as the first specialization. Beyond that, feel free to complete a different specialization each tier, or dive deeply into a specialization by selecting it during multiple tiers to explore it in greater detail and further develop your specialized profile.

### Beginner Specializations

- [Web Development - Fullstack Bootcamp - App Academy Open](./specializations/app_academy_open.md) (recommended, but not required, first specialization)
- [Web Development - Deep Dive Into Modern Web Development - Full Stack Open 2020](./specializations/full_stack_open_2020.md)
- [Web Development - Fullstack Bootcamp - The Odin Project](./specializations/the_odin_project.md)
- [Web Development - Frontend](./specializations/frontend.md)
- [Web Development - Backend](./specializations/backend.md)
- [Mobile App Development](./specializations/mobile.md)
- [Game Development](./specializations/games.md)
- [Open Source Contributions](./specializations/open_source.md)

### Advanced Specializations

The following specializations rely on knowledge gained in earlier tiers. Additionally, they are typically 'more difficult' or will require more work than those listed above.

- [Computer Science - Algorithms](./specializations/algorithms.md) -Suggested for Tier 2 or later
- [Computer Science - Advanced Algorithms](./specializations/advanced-algorithms.md) - Computer Science - Algorithms is a pre-requisite
- [Computer Science - Intensive](./specializations/computer_science.md) - Suggested for Tier 4 or later
- [Data Science I](./specializations/data-science-i.md) - Suggested for Tier 2 or later
- [Data Science II](./specializations/data-science-ii.md) - Data Science I is a pre-requisite
